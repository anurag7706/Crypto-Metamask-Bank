# Crypto Bank Project
## Starter Next/Hardhat Project

Welcome to the Crypto Bank project! This is a simulated digital banking application developed for educational purposes. The project aims to showcase the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a decentralized banking platform.
### Steps to follow :  

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/

## Features

- **Connect Your Wallet:** Simulate connecting your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the application and interact with smart contracts.

- **Account Management:** View your simulated account balance and transaction history in real-time.

- **Deposit & Withdraw:** Simulate depositing or withdrawing cryptocurrency seamlessly with just a few clicks.

- **Transaction History:** Explore the simulated transaction history with details of each transaction.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a modern and intuitive interface designed to showcase blockchain integration.



## How It Works

Crypto Bank utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to handle account balances and transactions. The project incorporates web3.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain on the local test network. As this is a simulated project, no real cryptocurrency or financial transactions are involved.

## Security

Please note that this project is purely for educational and demonstrational purposes. As it operates on a local test network, no real funds or sensitive information are at risk. However, it is essential to maintain security best practices when deploying smart contracts in real-world applications.

## Support

As this project is not intended for production use, there is no official support. However, you can explore the code, experiment with the smart contracts, and learn more about blockchain technology on your own.
